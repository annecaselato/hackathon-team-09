## 🎬 The SIFAP Story

Picture this. It is 1995. A small team of engineers at DATACORP builds a system to pay social benefits to millions of citizens. They pick the best tools available at the time: **Natural**, a language designed for fast data processing, and **Adabas**, a hierarchical database known for reliability. They name it **SIFAP**, the *Sistema Integrado de Folha de Pagamentos*.

The system works. It pays citizens on time, month after month. The people who built it move on. New people are hired. The business changes. Laws change. Payments rules change. Every few years, someone patches SIFAP to handle a new rule, a new benefit category, a new exception. Nobody rewrites it. Nobody dares to. It just keeps running.

Fast forward to **2026**. SIFAP is still running. It processes millions of payments every month. But it is not the quiet hero it used to be. It has become a burden.

- The original architects are long gone.
- The source code has abbreviations nobody remembers the meaning of.
- Every change requires a week of testing, because there are no automated tests.
- The mainframe licenses cost the company more every year.
- Citizens want to check their benefits from a phone. SIFAP has no API.
- Partners want to integrate. SIFAP has no modern endpoint.
- Operators still use green screen terminals. Nobody under 35 knows how to navigate them.

**That is where your team comes in.** You have 1 day, 100 developers, 10 teams, and a box full of AI tools. Your mission is to prove that legacy modernization, the kind that used to take 2 years and a consulting army, can now happen in hours, with the right approach.

Welcome to the Hackathon DATACORP 2026.

## ⚠️ Why SIFAP Must Change

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulasilvatech/hackathon-datacorp-team-kit/main/assets/sifap-pain-points.svg" alt="5 pain points of the legacy SIFAP system" width="100%"/>
</p>

| # | Pain Point | Business Impact |
|---|------------|-----------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Knowledge silos** | A handful of people know how SIFAP works. When they leave, the company is exposed. |
| 2️⃣ | **Cryptic code** | 8 character abbreviations, no comments, no docs. Every change starts with archaeology. |
| 3️⃣ | **Zero tests** | Changes are gambles. A fix in one module silently breaks another from 15 years ago. |
| 4️⃣ | **Costly licenses** | Mainframe licenses consume budget that should fund innovation. |
| 5️⃣ | **No integrations** | Mobile, partners, modern channels. All blocked by the monolith. |

> 💡 **Analogy.** Legacy SIFAP is like a 30 year old family car that still runs but needs a full tank of gas, a carburetor adjustment every month, and only one mechanic in town can service it. Modernizing is not about buying a faster car. It is about trading it for a reliable electric vehicle the whole family can drive.

## 🎯 Your Mission in 8 Hours

Your team has one clear goal. Rebuild SIFAP with a modern stack, prove that AI assisted Spec Driven Development delivers, and ship something demo worthy by the end of the day.

| Deliverable | Format | Stage |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| 🗺️ **Legacy map and glossary** | Markdown in `01-arqueologia/` | Stage 1 |
| 📜 **Modern specification** | EARS requirements + ADRs in the **reference modern spec** (provided by facilitators) | Stage 2 |
| 💻 **Working prototype** | Java 21 + Next.js 15 code | Stage 3 |
| ☁️ **Infrastructure and CI/CD** | Terraform + GitHub Actions | Stage 4 |
| 🎤 **Final pitch** | 5 minute demo | End of day |

## 👥 Your Team

<p align="center">

| Stage | Folder | What your team does |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| 🔍 **Archaeology** | [`01-arqueologia/`](01-arqueologia/) | Explore SIFAP, map rules, find the hidden mysteries |
| 📜 **Modern Spec** | [`02-spec-moderna/`](02-spec-moderna/) | Write EARS requirements, capture ADRs, design the target |
| 💻 **Implementation** | [`03-implementacao/`](03-implementacao/) | Build Java backend, Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL schema |
| 🚀 **Evolution** | [`04-evolucao/`](04-evolucao/) | Terraform to Azure, GitHub Actions pipeline, final demo |

## 🏗️ From Legacy to Modern

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulasilvatech/hackathon-datacorp-team-kit/main/assets/architecture-transformation.svg" alt="Legacy to modern architecture transformation" width="100%"/>
</p>

> 💡 **Think of it as a kitchen renovation.** The legacy SIFAP is a kitchen from 1995: functional, but tight, hard to clean, with appliances only one brand still services. The modern SIFAP is an open, modular kitchen where every appliance speaks a standard protocol, and anyone can plug in new devices.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Kit

### 📦 Reference materials provided by facilitators

The stage guides mention these external folders. Facilitators distribute them at the start of the event, or you run `./scripts/setup.sh` to clone them as symlinks. Either way, the paths in the guides will work.

| Stage | Folder | Purpose |
|:---:|---|---|
| 1 | `legacy/` | Natural programs, Adabas DDMs, legacy docs ([sifap-legacy](https://github.com/paulasilvatech/sifap-legacy)) |
| 2 | — | Reference modern specification (read on GitHub: **reference modern spec** (shared by facilitators)) |
| 3 | `prototype/` | Reference prototype (Java + Next.js) |
| 4 | `infra/` | Reference Terraform modules for Azure |

### 🚀 Getting started

**Full step-by-step setup is in [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md)** — covers GitHub repo creation, Copilot activation, Spec-Kit + Specky installation, branch strategy, and the 12-item smoke test.

Quick summary (full instructions in `SETUP.md`):

```bash
# 1. Create your team's GitHub repo (one person, once)
gh repo create paulasilvatech/hackathon-team-XX --private --add-readme

# 2. Bootstrap from this kit
git clone https://github.com/paulasilvatech/hackathon-datacorp-team-kit.git kit
git clone https://github.com/paulasilvatech/hackathon-team-XX.git

cp -R ../kit/. . && rm -rf .git
git init -b main
git remote add origin https://github.com/paulasilvatech/hackathon-team-XX.git

# 3. Bootstrap script (clones sifap-legacy, sets up symlinks)
./scripts/setup.sh

# 4. Open in VS Code with the dev container
code .
# Then: Ctrl+Shift+P > "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
```

> ⚠️ **Heads up.** The reference prototype and Terraform modules are delivered by facilitators at the start of Stages 3 and 4 respectively. Do not attempt to fetch them from this repository.
